1. What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
When you merge one branch into another, Git creates a new commit that has two parent commits: one from the source branch and one from the target branch. This creates a merge commit that represents the integration of changes. Merge preserves the commit history of both branches. In contrast, Rebase rewrites the commit history. When you rebase a branch onto another, Git replays the commits from the source branch on top of the target branch. In other words, the entire branch is being "moved" onto a new base.
